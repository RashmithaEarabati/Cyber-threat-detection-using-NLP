I'm a fresher passionate about AI and cybersecurity, exploring how NLP can make the digital world a safer place. This project is part of my learning journey into intelligent threat detection.
# 🔐 Cyber Threat Detection using NLP

A machine learning-based project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically detect and analyze emerging cyber threats from online textual data, such as tweets, forums, and threat intelligence reports.

## 📌 About the Project

Cybersecurity threats are evolving faster than ever. This project explores the use of NLP techniques to identify and categorize potential cyber threats in real time, focusing on detecting malicious intent, malware indicators, or vulnerability mentions from textual data sources.

> 💡 *"Transforming unstructured text into actionable threat intelligence."*

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- **Python**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Scikit-learn / NLTK / spaCy / Transformers**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**  
- **Twitter API / Sample threat datasets**

## 🚀 Key Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization)  
- Keyword and pattern-based threat detection  
- Sentiment & intent classification  
- Real-time threat feed analysis (from Twitter or datasets)  
- Visualization of threat frequency and types

## 📊 Sample Outputs

- Threat keywords detected: `malware`, `zero-day`, `exploit`, `phishing`  
- Sentiment classification: `Threat / Safe / Suspicious`  
- Sample tweet classification:  
  _"New zero-day vulnerability discovered in XYZ software."_ → **Detected Threat**

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
